# ONLINE RESERVATION SYSTEM

As part of my internship with Oasis Infobyte, I developed an Online Reservation System using Java in Spring Tool Suite (STS) with Maven for dependency management. The project was designed to streamline the reservation process, offering users a seamless and intuitive interface for booking, managing, and cancelling reservations.

Project Overview:
The Online Reservation System is a comprehensive application that manages various aspects of reservations, including user authentication, booking, and cancellations. The system provides a user-friendly interface with robust backend functionalities, ensuring a smooth and secure experience for all users.

Key Features:

Reservation Functionality:

Users can search for available options, enter journey details (such as train number, class type, and journey dates), and make reservations with ease. The system validates all inputs to ensure accurate and reliable bookings.

Cancellation System:

Developed a cancellation feature that allows users to cancel their reservations using a unique PNR number. The system retrieves booking details and processes cancellations, updating the database accordingly.

Reservation History:

Users can view their booking history, providing a detailed overview of past and current reservations, including dates, times, and status.

Database Management:

Utilized MySQL as the database to manage user data, reservations, and cancellations, ensuring data integrity and consistency throughout the application.
